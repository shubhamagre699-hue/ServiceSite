                    restrictions.</li>
                <li>Delivery begins only after payment has been verified manually by our team.</li>
                <li>All orders are processed between <strong>10 AM – 10 PM IST</strong>. Orders placed outside these

                <li>Some services (especially followers) are delivered gradually to appear organic.</li>
                <li>Do NOT change your username, make your account private, or delete content during active delivery.
                </li>
                <li>If you make your account private during delivery, services may stop and no refund will be issued.
